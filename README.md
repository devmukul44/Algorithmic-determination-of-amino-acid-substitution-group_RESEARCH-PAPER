# Research on Algorithmic determination of amino acid substitution group

#ABSTRACT

Most of the existing approaches view amino acid substitution as a pairwise phenomenon. Most methods
characterizes it using substitution matrices. Some methods focus on determination of substitution groups based on
the theoretical properties satisfied by the substitution groups. Be it any method algorithms on these reliable
techniques are required for actual determination of the amino acid substitutions. In this paper we provide an
algorithmic approach for determination of amino acid substitution group.
